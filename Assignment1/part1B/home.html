                So, why a guide to the best online guitar lessons you may ask? Many guitarists consider 
                themselves to be self-taught. But to what extent is this really accurate and how 
                well-rounded a player are they? Did they pick up a guitar, figure out the right notes, 
                develop a technique and bring it to bear without any outside influence? Of course not.
            </p>

                Our musical knowledge must come from somewhere, and while finding a guitar teacher with 
                whom you can share a physical space, and who inspires you to work on your technique is 
                a great option, in the internet era the importance of physical space is diminished when 
                it comes to guitar lessons. Plus, the quality of online learning tools and content have 
                improved dramatically over the years.

                platform to help you become the best player you can be? Or, if youâ€™re hankering for a new 
                hobby, now could be the moment to start learning a new instrument or take the next steps in 
                your playing development. If this describes you, then this guide to the best online guitar
