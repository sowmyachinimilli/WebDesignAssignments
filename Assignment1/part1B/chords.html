        In this guitar lesson, we’ll be diving into the five most important chords you’ll 
        learn on the guitar. We’ll also talk a bit about why they’re superior to the other 
        chords you’ll learn. As we go through this lesson, we’ll cover the ways to make 
        each chord and also the notes in each chord. So whether you’re a beginner or an 
        intermediate player you’ll be sure to learn something from this video.

        The reason these chords are so important is that every chord you’ll learn down 
        the road is based on one of these five shapes. So these shapes will continue to work 
        for you for years to come. The system that these shapes are a part of is called the 
        CAGED System – heard of it before? It’s an excellent way to navigate the fretboard 
        and have a deeper understanding of this instrument we all love!
